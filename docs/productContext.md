# Product Context: Multi-Channel Audio Monitor

## Core Purpose
The Multi-Channel Audio Monitor (MCAM) provides audio professionals with a simple yet powerful tool for monitoring multiple audio channels simultaneously, with professional-grade metering and frequency analysis.

## Target Users
- **Studio Engineers**: Monitoring mix elements
- **Live Sound Engineers**: Checking multiple audio feeds
- **Broadcast Engineers**: Verifying audio levels and quality
- **AV Technicians**: Monitoring distributed audio systems
- **Educational Settings**: Audio analysis for teaching

## Key Use Cases
1. **Live Monitoring**: Real-time level checking of multiple audio sources
2. **Signal Path Verification**: Confirming audio is present and properly routed
3. **Frequency Analysis**: Identifying frequency content issues across sources
4. **Remote Control**: Integration with show control systems via REST API
5. **Educational Demonstration**: Visual representation of audio concepts

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear visualization with minimal learning curve
- **Professional Quality**: Accurate metering adhering to industry standards
- **Flexible Monitoring**: Easy selection of channels and meter types
- **Minimal Configuration**: Quick setup with sensible defaults
- **Stability**: Rock-solid performance for critical monitoring situations

## Competitive Landscape
