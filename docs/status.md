# Project Status

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Core Framework (In Progress)

We have completed the JUCE application setup task from Phase 1. This includes:

- Created a main application class with proper window management
- Implemented a configurable application properties system
- Added a flexible logging system for application diagnostics
- Set up window state persistence (size, position)
- Created a basic MainComponent with UI elements
- Implemented test cases for the new components

The next steps in Phase 1 are:
1. Implement the basic audio pipeline
2. Create the minimal UI layout for the application

### Implementation Details

#### Logger System
- Implemented a singleton-based logger with multiple severity levels
- Supports logging to both console and file
- Thread-safe implementation with mutex protection
- Automatically creates log directory if it doesn't exist

#### Application Properties
- Uses JUCE's ApplicationProperties for persistent settings
- Saves window position and size
- Structured for adding more application settings later

#### Build System
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to include the new Logger class
- Created a build script to simplify the build process
- Added logs directory creation to the build process

#### Test Framework
- Implemented test cases for the Logger system
- Added tests for application properties
- Created a mock component for testing UI interactions

## Next Steps

1. Implement audio device detection (Basic Audio Pipeline)
2. Create audio callback structure for processing
3. Set up buffer processing framework
4. Create UI layout for the application

## Challenges & Solutions

- **JUCE Setup**: Added a build script to automatically locate JUCE installation or prompt the user to set the JUCE_DIR variable
- **Logging**: Implemented a thread-safe logging system to help with debugging and diagnostics
- **Testing**: Added test cases that don't require audio device access to ensure testability
